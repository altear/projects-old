# Get Test Images
this script is used to download images from imagenet to test future cv algorithms

imagenet:
# Installation
run python easy_install with the **folder** path (not the nested script of the same name)
```
$ python3 -m easy_install path/to/get_test_images/
```

# Usage
Onc e installed, the script will be available through the console cmd "get-test-images".
Simply run the script in python now
```
$ get-test-images
```

This will create a folder for `imagenet/person/` in the current working directory, and download the images into it.
